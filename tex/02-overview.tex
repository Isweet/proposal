Why should we care about the properties outlined in~\Cref{sec:intro-mpc-obliv}? To answer this question,
we'll first need to describe the \mpc language in more depth so that it may be used as the \textit{lingua franca}
for the remainder of the proposal. We will assume that readers are familiar with MPC and ORAM. For readers who don't have this
background,~\Cref{ch:gmw,ch:oram} provide an overview of the GMW MPC protocol and ORAM respectively.

\section{\mpc By Example}
\label{sec:background-symphony}

As a means of gentle introduction, let's consider the classic Millionaire's Problem in which two wealthy parties,
\alice and \bob, would like to know who is wealthier.

\caption{\mpc code for the Millionaire's Problem.}
\label{fig:millionaires-symphony}
\end{figure}

The code in~\Cref{fig:millionaires-symphony} is written in the \mpc language. On line 0, the ‚∏®‚¶ëpar‚¶í[\alice,\bob]‚∏© expression
indicates that both \alice and \bob should execute the body of the expression. Any other principals will ignore the
body of the expression and generate an \emph{opaque value}, denoted \opaque, instead. On line 1, \alice reads her wealth,
‚∏®\alices{‚ãñwealth‚ãó}‚∏©, from local storage and binds it to ‚∏®x‚∏©. \bob evaluates the expression ‚∏®‚¶ëpar‚¶í[\alice]‚ê£‚¶ëread‚¶í‚∏© to
\opaque because he is not included in principals declared by the ‚∏®‚¶ëpar‚¶í[\alice]‚∏© expression. On line 2, \bob reads his wealth,
‚∏®\bobs{‚ãñwealth‚ãó}‚∏©, and binds it to ‚∏®y‚∏© while \alice binds \opaque to ‚∏®y‚∏©. In summary, after line 2, the local environemnts are:

M‚ÅÖ
  AÀêcc
  A‚ÅÖ \alice & \bob
  A‚ÅÉ ‚ü®x ‚Ü¶ \alices{‚ãñwealth‚ãó},‚ê£y ‚Ü¶ \opaque‚ü©‚ê† & ‚ê†‚ü®x ‚Ü¶ \opaque,‚ê£y ‚Ü¶ \bobs{‚ãñwealth‚ãó}‚ü©
  A‚ÅÜ
M‚ÅÜ

On line 3, \alice splits her ‚∏®\alices{‚ãñwealth‚ãó}‚∏© into two shares. She keeps her share and sends \bob's share to him. We use the same
notation for shares which appears in \Cref{ch:gmw} to emphasize the connection between the explanation of GMW and the execution model
of \mpc. On line 4, \bob splits his ‚∏®\bobs{‚ãñwealth‚ãó}‚∏© into two shares. He keeps his share and send's \alice's share to her. So, after
line 4 the local environments are:

M‚ÅÖ
  AÀêllll
  A‚ÅÖ ùëöùëê2c{\alice} & ùëöùëê2c{\bob}
    A‚ÅÉ ‚ü®‚Ä¶,&‚ê£x‚Çõ ‚Ü¶ \aliceSh{\alices{‚ãñwealth‚ãó}}, & ‚ê†‚ü®‚Ä¶,&‚ê£x‚Çõ ‚Ü¶ \bobSh{\alices{‚ãñwealth‚ãó}},
    A‚ÅÉ    &‚ê£y‚Çõ ‚Ü¶ \aliceSh{\bobs{‚ãñwealth‚ãó}}‚ü©   &     &‚ê£y‚Çõ ‚Ü¶ \bobSh{\bobs{‚ãñwealth‚ãó}}‚ü©
  A‚ÅÜ
M‚ÅÜ

On line 5, \alice and \bob compute over their shares to produce a share indicating who is wealthier. Here we assume that the language knows
how to compute ‚∏®<‚∏© over shares. For example, if the underlying MPC protocol were GMW then we would encode ‚∏®<‚∏© as a magnitude circuit made
up of XOR and AND gates.

M‚ÅÖ
  AÀêcc
  A‚ÅÖ \alice & \bob
  A‚ÅÉ ‚ü®‚Ä¶,‚ê£r ‚Ü¶ \aliceSh{A‚∏®\alices{‚ãñwealth‚ãó} < \bobs{‚ãñwealth‚ãó}A‚∏©}‚ü© & ‚ê†‚ü®‚Ä¶,‚ê£r ‚Ü¶ \bobSh{A‚∏®\alices{‚ãñwealth‚ãó} < \bobs{‚ãñwealth‚ãó}A‚∏©}‚ü©
  A‚ÅÜ
M‚ÅÜ

Finally, on line 6, the shares of ‚∏®\alices{‚ãñwealth‚ãó} < \bobs{‚ãñwealth‚ãó}‚∏© among \alice and \bob are combined and the
result is revealed to both parties. The XOR operator, ‚∏®‚äï‚∏©, is used to combine shares implicitly as part of the ‚∏®‚¶ëreveal‚¶í‚∏©.

The Millionaire's Problem in~\Cref{fig:millionaires-symphony} illustrates two non-standard features of \mpc. First, the programmer
controls which parties evaluate which expressions by using ‚∏®‚¶ëpar‚¶í‚∏© expressions. This is in contrast to languages like OblivC
which must coordinate parties manually using ‚∏®‚¶ëif‚¶í‚∏© expressions. Second, clear and encrypted computations may be arbitrarily
interleaved. There is no phase distinction between clear and encrypted computation. Languages such as OblivC and Wysteria
require that clear and encrypted (MPC) computation be separated syntactically.

\section{Desirable Properties of MPC}
\label{sec:background-properties}

In~\Cref{sec:intro} we claimed that a MPC language ought to be \textbf{Abstractly Sequential}, \textbf{Probabilistic},
and \textbf{High Assurance}. But, what are these properties and why do we care about them?

\subsection{Abstractly Sequential}
\label{subsec:background-properties-centralized}

A language which is abstractly sequential liberates the programmer from managing a distributed computation. In the context of MPC,
the programmer does not need to perform commands conditionally on which party is executing. To see the difference, contrast the
Obliv-C implementation of the Millionaire's Problem in~\Cref{fig:millionaires-oblivc} with the \mpc implementation
in~\Cref{fig:millionaires-symphony}.

\mwh{But this program basically is abstractly sequential, because all
  parties will run literally the same code, which is doing the same
  thing. You need something like MMM to point out Obliv-C's
  failings. In sum: This example shows that Obliv-C is ugly, but
  doesn't make your case about abstract sequentiality.}

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{lstlisting}[language=c,basicstyle=\footnotesize\ttfamily,numbers=left,stepnumber=1]
  // File: million.h
  typedef struct {
    int in;
    bool out;
  } ProtocolIO;

  void millionaire (void *args);

  // File: million.oc
  #include <million.h>
  #include <obliv.oh>

  void millionaire (void *args) {
    ProtocolIO *io = args;
    obliv int a, b;
    obliv bool res = false;
    a = feedOblivInt (io->in, 1);
    b = feedOblivInt (io->in, 2);
    obliv if (a < b) res = true;
    revealOblivBool(&io->out, res, 0);
  }

  // File: million.c
  #include <million.h>

  int main (int argc, char *argv[]) {
    ProtocolDesc pd;
    ProtocolIO io;
    int p = (argv[1] == '1' ? 1 : 2);
    sscanf(argv[2], "%d", &io.in);
    // ... set up TCP connections

    setCurrentParty(&pd, p);
    execYaoProtocol(&pd, millionaire, &io);
    printf ("%d\n", io.out);
    // ... cleanup
  }
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Obliv-C code for the Millionaire's Problem}
\label{fig:millionaires-oblivc}
\end{figure}

Hopefully it is clear that many of the details of the distributed deployment have leaked into the application code.
The \lstinline[language=c,basicstyle=\ttfamily]{main} function is responsible for scaffolding such as establishing TCP connections (line 31),
explicitly executing the protocol (line 34), and populating the \lstinline[language=c,basicstyle=\ttfamily]{io} variable with party inputs (line 30). As
a point of comparison, take a look back at~\Cref{fig:millionaires-symphony}. Notice that this code makes no mention of TCP connections,
explicit execution of any protocol, or eagerly reading and caching secret inputs. Dealing with such infrastructure can be annoying, but
is it safe? By allowing the programmer to execute code conditionally based on which party is executing, languages like Obliv-C allow code
which has all the usual pitfalls of distributed programming. For example, deadlock caused by both parties attempting to receive values
from each other before they have performed a send.

In Chapter~\ref{ch:lam-mpc} we formally define \textbf{Abstractly Sequential} MPC languages as those which satisfy~\nameref{thm:mpc-safety} and~\nameref{thm:mpc-simulation}.
~\nameref{thm:mpc-safety} guarantees that well-typed \mpc programs don't get stuck (encounter a runtime error).~\nameref{thm:mpc-simulation} guarantees
that the sequential interpretation of a program terminates successfully if and only if the distributed interpretation terminates successfully (with the same
result). These two theorems work together to guarantee that well-typed programs can't encounter liveness errors.

\subsection{Probabilistic}
\label{subsec:background-properties-probabilistic}

In our terminology, an MPC language is \textbf{Probabilistic} if it supports a primitive for drawing uniform, random samples from a
discrete, finite set. For example, drawing a uniform, random sample from ‚∏®ùîπ‚∏©, the Booleans, corresponds to a fair coin toss. We
could also draw from ‚∏®‚Ñï‚∏§32‚∏•‚∏©, Natural numbers modulo ‚∏®2^{32}‚∏©. Why is such a primitive important in an MPC language?

As discussed in Chapter~\ref{sec:intro}, MPC languages rely on ORAM to support a RAM-model of computation. In their seminal paper,~\citet{}
showed that Trivial ORAM, which has an overhead of $O(n)$, is optimal in a deterministic language. However, provided the ability
to perform uniform, random samples, it is possible to design more efficient ORAMs. For example, tree-based ORAM schemes, including
(Recursive) Circuit ORAM, require the position tag to be uniformly random. In addition to ORAMs, there are optimized oblivious algorithms
and data structures which do not rely on ORAM, but do rely on randomness to achieve greater efficiency~\cite{}.

To see how the use of random sampling is used to improve efficiency, consider the \mpc{} code in~\Cref{fig:mpc-2-oram}. The purpose of
this code is to allow \bob to choose one of two secrets belonging to \alice without \alice learning which one \bob chose. On lines 1-2,
\alice shares two secrets, ‚∏®s‚∏§A1‚∏•‚∏© and ‚∏®s‚∏§A2‚∏•‚∏©, with \bob. On line 3, \bob's choice, ‚∏®s‚∏§B‚∏•‚∏©, is shared with \alice.
On line 4, \bob flips a coin, ‚∏®u‚∏©, which he shares with \alice. On lines 5-6, the array, ‚∏®a‚∏©, is populated
in-order if the coin ‚∏®u‚∏© is heads (‚∏®0‚∏©), and out-of-order if the coin is tails (‚∏®1‚∏©). Finally, on line 7 the XOR of \bob's choice with the
coin is revealed to both parties. Notice that if \bob's choice was ‚∏®0‚∏© (heads) then he always gets ‚∏®s‚∏§A1‚∏•‚∏© and
likewise for ‚∏®1‚∏© (tails) and ‚∏®s‚∏§A2‚∏•‚∏©.

This code illustrates the importance of random sampling for efficient RAM access. If the MPC program had instead stored the array ‚∏®a‚∏© in
a Trivial ORAM then the lookup on line 8 would require 2 accesses (one for each element in the ORAM). This may not seem so bad, but consider
the overhead if \bob wanted to choose from an array of length ‚∏®n‚∏©. In that case, the lookup would incur an $O(n)$ overhead!

\subsection{High Assurance}
\label{subsec:background-properties-assurance}

An MPC language is \textbf{High Assurance} if it guarantees that programs are oblivious by construction.
Existing MPC languages with support for uniform, random sampling cannot be considered high assurance because
they do not allow developers to distinguish between \emph{declassification} and \emph{benign exposure}.
A declassification intends to leak some necessary information about secrets. The information leak is part of
the specification of the program. A benign exposure intends not to leak any information about secrets. Freedom
from information leaks is part of the specification. For example, the Millionaire's Problem in~\Cref{fig:millionaires-symphony}
features a declassification. The developer expects that declassification of the comparison will leak some information about the wealth of the
participants. In contrast, the ‚∏®‚¶ëreveal‚¶í‚∏© expressions in the One-Time Pad and Mini-ORAM examples (~\Cref{fig:otp-symphony,fig:mpc-2-oram})
are benign exposures. The developer expects that the ‚∏®‚¶ëreveal‚¶í‚∏© is not actually leaking any information about the secrets
of either party.

Existing MPC languages provide only a mechanism for declassification. These declassifications are trusted and any
information leaked is assumed to be intentional. Unfortunately, this means that benign exposures must also use the
declassification mechanism. As such, the leak-freedom of those exposures is not, and cannot be, checked by the language.
Consider what happens if we change line 7 in the Mini-ORAM example to declassify ‚∏®s‚∏§B‚∏•‚∏©.
In that case, the functional correctness of the program is unaffected but we have accidentally leaked \bob's secret to \alice!
This information leak could have been prevented by a language which provides a mechanism to certify that benign exposures do
not leak any information.

Both MPC applications and libraries rely on benign exposure. Cryptographers rely on benign exposure to implement secure protocols such as ORAM,
Function Secret Sharing~\cite{}, and Zero-Knowledge Proofs\cite{}. Cryptographers are not the only ones who we expect to leverage the
benign exposure mechanism. It turns out that many application-level algorithms and data structures also rely on benign exposure. For example,
various comparison-based algorithms in MPC are optimized by permuting the collection prior to sorting~\cite{hamada2012}. This allows occurrences of
comparison in the sorting algorithm to use ‚∏®‚¶ëif‚¶í‚∏© over declassified comparison, instead of a multiplexor. These sorts of algorithms and
data structures are more likely to be implemented by developers who are not experts in cryptography.

A high assurance language is beneficial to both MPC experts and novices. Experts save time and gain confidence in their
experimental protocols by relying on the language to enforce confidentiality. For example, modifying line 7 in
Figure~\ref{fig:mpc-2-oram} to use a benign exposure means it need not be manually audited. Instead, the language would ensure that the
exposure is safe. Likewise, MPC novices will benefit by being able to safely experiment with their own cryptographic optimizations
without fear of accidentally leaking information they didn't intend to. They need only mark exposures that are expected to be
leak-free appropriately.

In~\Cref{ch:lam-obliv,ch:proposal} we formally define \textbf{High Assurance} languages as those which satisfy~\nameref{thm:obliv-pmto} and~\nameref{thm:lang-pmto}
respectively. In the former, we discuss \obliv which is not an MPC language and doesn't have declassifications. It only contains what we referred to above
as benign exposure. In the latter, we discuss \lang which is an MPC language and therefore has declassifications. As such, we must generalize~\nameref{thm:obliv-pmto}
to~\nameref{thm:lang-pmto} to take declassifications into account. In both languages, a sound static type system is used as the enforcement mechanism. Only well-typed
programs are guaranteed to be oblivious.

\ins{IDEA: In future paper, implement quicksort (1) on top of ORAM and then (2) using permutation optimization. Show that (2) is much
  faster, which suggests that building ORAM into the language and using it everywhere is not a good solution.}
