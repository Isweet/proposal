\emph{Secure Multiparty Computation} (MPC) has emerged as a promising approach to mutually confidential computation.
Traditionally, MPC programs do not allow memory to be addressed using secret values. This precludes, for example,
a secure binary search in which the element being accessed is considered secret.
This restriction is relaxed by ensuring that the secure computation is (probabilistically) \emph{oblivious}.
Unfortunately, existing languages for MPC do not support efficient, oblivious programming. We propose \lang,
a probabilistically oblivious language for MPC. We will show that \lang can express asymptotically optimal
secure ORAM (SC-ORAM) constructions, thereby proving that they are oblivious. This will allow for provably secure,
asymptotically optimal implementations of RAM-model secure computations, such as binary search.
