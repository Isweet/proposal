Ellora features new proof rules for loops and adversarial code, and supports richer assertions than existing program logics. We also show that Ellora allows convenient reasoning about complex probabilistic concepts by developing a new program logic for probabilistic independence and distribution law, and then smoothly embedding it into Ellora.",

                  imperative programs to probabilistic semantics. This
                  semantics allows for random external inputs of known
                  or unknown probability and random number
                  generators. We then propose a method of analysis of
                  programs according to this semantics, in the general
                  framework of abstract interpretation. This method
                  lifts an ``ordinary'' abstract lattice, for
                  non-probabilistic programs, to one suitable for
                  probabilistic programs. Our construction is highly
                  generic. We discuss the influence of certain
                  parameters on the precision of the analysis, basing
                  ourselves on experimental results.},

abstract="Most probabilistic programming languages for Bayesian inference give either operational semantics in terms of sampling, or denotational semantics in terms of measure-theoretic distributions. It is important that we can relate the two, given that practitioners often reason both analytically (e.g., density) as well as algorithmically (i.e., in terms of sampling) about distributions. In this paper, we give denotational semantics to a functional language extended with continuous distributions and show that by restricting attention to computable distributions, we can realize a corresponding sampling semantics.",
